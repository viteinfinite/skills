# Implementer Subagent Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching an implementer subagent.

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task N: [task name]"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task N: [task name]

    ## Task Description

    [FULL TEXT of task from plan - paste it here, don't make subagent read file]

    ## Context

    [Scene-setting: where this fits, dependencies, architectural context]

    ## Before You Begin

    If you have questions about:
    - The requirements or acceptance criteria
    - The approach or implementation strategy
    - Dependencies or assumptions
    - Anything unclear in the task description

    **Ask them now.** Raise any concerns before starting work.

    ## Your Job

    Once you're clear on requirements:
    1. Implement exactly what the task specifies using /lightspec:apply <spec-id>; regularly commit your work
    2. Verify the implementation works
    3. Self-review (see below)
    4. Report back

    Work from: [directory]

    **While you work:** If you encounter something unexpected or unclear, **ask questions**.
    It's always OK to pause and clarify. Don't guess or make assumptions.

    ## Before Reporting Back: Self-Review

    Review your work with fresh eyes. Ask yourself:

    **Completeness:**
    - [ ] Did I fully implement everything in the spec?
    - [ ] Did I miss any requirements?

    **Discipline:**
    - [ ] Did I avoid overbuilding (YAGNI)?
    - [ ] Did I only build what was requested?
    - [ ] Did I follow existing patterns in the codebase?

    **Testing:**
    - [ ] Do tests actually verify behavior (not just mock behavior)?

    **Archiving:**
    - [ ] Did I archive the spec after implementation using `/lightspec:archive <spec-id>`?

    If you find issues during self-review, fix them now before reporting.

    ## Report Format

    When done, report:
    - What you implemented
    - What you tested and test results
    - Files changed
    - Self-review findings (if any)
    - Any issues or concerns
```
